This is a crucial area because it's about expanding the \"toolbox\" available to drug developers, moving beyond the traditional pillars of small molecules and protein-based drugs (like antibodies).\n\nLet's break down the key \"novel modalities\" and why they are significant:\n\n**1. RNA Therapeutics:**\n\n*   **What they are:** These therapies use RNA molecules to influence gene expression. Instead of directly interacting with a protein, they can instruct cells to produce more of a beneficial protein, less of a harmful one, or even to target specific RNA molecules for degradation.\n    *   **mRNA (messenger RNA):** Carries the genetic code for a protein. As seen with COVID-19 vaccines, mRNA can be delivered into cells, telling them to produce a specific protein (like a viral spike protein to train the immune system). In a therapeutic context, it could instruct cells to produce a missing or deficient protein (e.g., for genetic disorders).\n    *   **siRNA (small interfering RNA) & shRNA (short hairpin RNA):** These molecules can silence specific genes by targeting and degrading their mRNA transcripts. This is useful for diseases where a particular protein is overproduced or causing harm.\n    *   **Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs):** These are short, synthetic strands of DNA or RNA that can bind to specific mRNA sequences, either blocking translation into protein or altering splicing patterns of the mRNA.\n    *   **MicroRNAs (miRNAs):** Naturally occurring RNA molecules that regulate gene expression, and can be mimicked or inhibited therapeutically.\n\n*   **Why they are significant:**\n    *   **Precision:** Can target specific genes or gene products with high accuracy.\n    *   **Versatility:** Potential applications for a wide range of diseases, including genetic disorders, viral infections, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases.\n    *   **Speed:** Once a target gene is identified, designing an RNA therapeutic can sometimes be faster than developing a traditional small molecule or antibody.\n    *   **Addressing \"Undruggable\" Targets:** Many disease-causing proteins are difficult to target with traditional drugs. RNA therapies offer new ways to tackle these challenges.\n\n*   **Recent Developments:**\n    *   The success of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines has significantly boosted investment and research in mRNA technology for other applications.\n    *   Several siRNA and ASO drugs have already been approved for conditions like rare genetic diseases (e.g., spinal muscular atrophy, hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis).\n    *   Ongoing research into more efficient and targeted delivery systems is critical, as getting RNA into the right cells in the body remains a hurdle.\n\n**2. Peptide Therapeutics:**\n\n*   **What they are:** Peptides are short chains of amino acids, smaller than proteins. They are natural signaling molecules in the body and can be designed to mimic or block the action of endogenous peptides.\n\n*   **Why they are significant:**\n    *   **Specificity:** Peptides can be highly specific to their target receptors.\n    *   **Potency:** They can be very potent at low doses.\n    *   **Favorable Safety Profile:** Often have a better safety profile than small molecules or antibodies because they are derived from natural building blocks.\n    *   **Improved Manufacturing:** Generally easier and cheaper to manufacture compared to antibodies.\n\n*   **Recent Developments:**\n    *   **GLP-1 receptor agonists** (like semaglutide and liraglutide, used for diabetes and weight loss) are a prime example of successful peptide therapeutics.\n    *   Development of longer-acting peptides to reduce dosing frequency.\n    *   Exploration of peptides for cancer treatment, autoimmune diseases, and neurological disorders.\n    *   AI is playing a role in designing novel peptide sequences with enhanced stability and efficacy.\n\n**3. Gene Editing Technologies (e.g., CRISPR-Cas9):**\n\n*   **What they are:** Technologies that allow precise modification of DNA sequences within cells. This can involve correcting mutations that cause genetic diseases, inserting therapeutic genes, or disrupting genes that contribute to disease.\n\n*   **Why they are significant:**\n    *   **Curative Potential:** Offers the possibility of a one-time treatment that permanently corrects the underlying genetic defect, rather than just managing symptoms.\n    *   **Broad Applicability:** Potential for treating a vast array of monogenic disorders (diseases caused by a single gene defect).\n\n*   **Recent Developments:**\n    *   The first CRISPR-based gene editing therapy, **Casgevy**, was approved in the UK and US for sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, marking a historic moment.\n    *   Ongoing clinical trials for other genetic diseases like hereditary blindness and specific forms of cancer.\n    *   Challenges include delivery to the target cells (often ex vivo, where cells are removed, edited, and reinfused), off-target edits, and long-term safety.\n\n**4. Targeted Protein Degradation (TPD):**\n\n*   **What they are:** Instead of inhibiting a protein's function, TPD aims to eliminate the protein itself. It involves attaching a \"tag\" to a target protein that flags it for destruction by the cell's natural protein disposal machinery (the ubiquitin-proteasome system).\n    *   **PROTACs (Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras):** A prominent class of TPD molecules that bridge the target protein with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, marking the target protein for degradation.\n\n*   **Why they are significant:**\n    *   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Can target proteins that are not easily inhibited by traditional small molecules, especially those that lack an active site.\n    *   **Catalytic Mechanism:** A single TPD molecule can lead to the degradation of multiple protein molecules, making them potentially highly potent.\n    *   **Overcoming Resistance:** Can be effective against cancer cells that have developed resistance to existing therapies.\n\n*   **Recent Developments:**\n    *   Several TPD candidates are in clinical trials, particularly for oncology.\n    *   Research is expanding beyond PROTACs to other TPD technologies.\n    *   AI is assisting in identifying suitable E3 ligases and designing molecules that can effectively recruit them to target proteins.\n\nThese novel modalities represent a paradigm shift in how we approach drug discovery. They offer the potential to tackle diseases that were previously considered untreatable and to develop therapies with greater precision and durability. The rapid pace of innovation in these areas is a major driving force in modern biomedical research.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the main companies involved in **Novel Modalities Beyond Small Molecules and Antibodies**.

Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.
